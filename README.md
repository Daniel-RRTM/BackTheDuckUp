## Description  

This Shellscript takes the path to a file and creates a separate copy for **every minute, hour and day**, like a **GFS/Rotation sheme**.  
Its a quick hack for someone to work on important projects without the need of reminding themself to save or even to learn a VCS.  

Its usable for **Windows 10** as well as **MacOs Big sur**!   
It currently just supports **just Files** and no directories.
